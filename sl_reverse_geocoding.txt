This document describes the URL format of SL's reverse geocoding feature that they use in their "Välj från karta" feature.

The URL is in this format:
http://reseplanerare.sl.se/bin/query.exe/sny?performLocating=512&tpl=reverselookup2json&look_nv=type|reverselookup|radius|500|get_addressid|yes|get_addresscoord|yes|x|17885734|y|59365913

The method used to fetch the data is GET, maybe POST works as well.

It should be pretty self-explanatory. The result is on this format:
{
    error : "0",
    x : "17949900",
    y : "59322554",
    name : "Orrspelsv&#228;gen 32, Bromma",
    urlname : "Orrspelsv%E4gen%2032,%20Bromma"
    ,dist : "15"
    ,addressid : "990012725"
    ,addressx : "17949031"
    ,addressy : "59324643"
}

To exclude addressx and addressy, change the |yes| after addresscoord to |no|. The same goes for get_addressid.
