Res hit med SL
================================================
This is the repo of the Res hit med SL Chrome extension. 

It's very much a work in progress and I imagine there are possibilites that go beyond the current ones (which is to redirect the user to SL.se with prefilled values), such as displaying the real time information or something similar. Maybe some nice usage of the omnibox would be possible as well.

TODO
===============================================
- Use the geolocation API per default, and fallback in a nice way to using addresses.
